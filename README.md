Inspiration:
----
Solid 1c dops of either BUBBLGUM or LAWNGR (index/ring LAWNGR, middle/pinky BUBBLGUM) that SHAKE into 2c strobie BUBBLGUM/LAWNGR
Solid LAWNGR/BUBBLGUM fade over 2 seconds
Anti's thumbs are basically what im going for(https://youtu.be/IT0zafAwxyI?t=3m15s)
He can entirely change the focus color of the show even though everything is completely equal is awesome

LAWNGR__ CC#: 7
BUBBLGUM CC#: 19

Implementation:
----
I was able to get dops and strobie, those are public domain information and Ramiro was kind enough to let us know.
I couldn't find an easy to way to switch between those two colors, I'll work on it and release Toxin2 or something
The alternates have my version of dops, then we have toxin/outbreak using normal strobie/dops and my dops
Hope you like it, have an excellent day!

----
Mode 1 = LAWNGR index/ring Fingers 1c strobie with 2c dops

Step 1:
Create a copy of the working OSM_NEO code, File > Save As...

Step 2:
Replace the whole file with the following code: from the first /* down to the bottom }// diov Loop

Step 3:
Upload to each of your chips.

Step 4:
Remember the following things

-Dune: “I must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration.
    I will face my fear. I will permit it to pass over me and through me. And when it has gone past I will turn
    the inner eye to see its path. Where the fear has gone there will be nothing. Only I will remain.” 

-Hannah Harto: Practice reckless optimism (It’s the idea that it’s hip and cool to hope for the best
    and try your hardest, even though the odds might be against you.)
